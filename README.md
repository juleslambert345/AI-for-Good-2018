# AI-for-Good-2018
Project done during the AI for good 2018 hackathon(done with python, pandas, scikit-learn)

The goal was to be able to predict treatements use from the symptoms people have for some chronic diseases. 

We used the Chronic illness: symptoms, treatments and triggers dataset from kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker

As results, we obtain a jaccard index of about 0.66 for the prediction.
